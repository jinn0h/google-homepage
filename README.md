This is my first TOP project the google homepage!

I'll be implementing what I've learned so far on the foundations of programming, starting with HTML and CSS.

The project should look like the basic Google search page.

Excited and nervous to learn programming, hope this will be a letter to myself that with practice and patience, someone like me can learn to code!

Best of luck and hope to read this file and look at all the progress I've made.
